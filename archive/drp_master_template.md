# Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

## Purpose
The purpose of this Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is to provide a structured approach to recovering critical business functions and IT systems in the event of a disruption. This plan ensures compliance with **NIST 800-53**, **FISMA**, and **FedRAMP** standards and aims to minimize downtime, safeguard data, and ensure business continuity.

---

## Objectives
- Protect critical business operations from unexpected disruptions.
- Minimize downtime and loss of data.
- Establish a clear framework for responding to and recovering from incidents.
- Ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
- Enhance organizational resilience and preparedness.

---

## Scope
This DRP applies to:
- **Critical Systems**: IT systems, applications, and networks essential for business operations.
- **Data Assets**: On-premises and cloud-based storage solutions.
- **Physical Assets**: Hardware, data centers, and other infrastructure.
- **Personnel**: Internal and external stakeholders responsible for disaster recovery efforts.

## Recovery Strategies
### Data Backup Strategy
- **Frequency**:
  - Daily incremental backups.
  - Weekly full backups.
- **Locations**:
  - On-site and off-site (e.g., cloud-based).
- **Backup Verification**:
  - Regular testing of backup integrity.

### System Recovery Strategy
- **On-Premises Systems**:
  - Procedures for server restoration.
- **Cloud Systems**:
  - Cloud failover mechanisms.
- **Network Recovery**:
  - Steps to restore connectivity.

### Communication Strategy
- **Internal Notifications**:

## Disaster Recovery Procedures
### Activation Criteria
- Define triggers for activating the DRP (e.g., service outages, security breaches, or physical damages).

### Step-by-Step Recovery Process
1. **Incident Assessment**:
   - Determine the severity and impact of the disruption.
2. **Plan Activation**:
   - Notify key personnel and stakeholders.
   - Initiate recovery protocols.
3. **Recovery Operations**:
   - Restore prioritized systems based on RTO/RPO.
4. **Validation**:
   - Conduct tests to ensure functionality.
5. **Return to Normal Operations**:
   - Deactivate recovery mode and resume normal business functions.

---

## Testing and Maintenance
### Testing Schedule
- **Frequency**:
  - Quarterly tabletop exercises.
  - Annual full-scale disaster recovery simulations.

### Testing Procedures
- Validate recovery steps and ensure compliance with defined RTO/RPO.
- Test backup and restoration processes.

### Plan Updates
- **When to Update**:
  - After significant organizational changes or system updates.
  - Following tests and audits.
- **Who is Responsible**:
  - Disaster Recovery Coordinator.
