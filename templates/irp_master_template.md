# Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## Purpose
The purpose of this Incident Response Plan (IRP) is to provide a structured and systematic approach for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. This plan aligns with **NIST 800-53**, **FISMA**, and **FedRAMP** standards, ensuring compliance and effective incident management.

---

## Objectives
- Minimize the impact of incidents on business operations, data integrity, and organizational reputation.
- Ensure a rapid, efficient, and compliant response to incidents.
- Protect sensitive data and critical systems from unauthorized access or compromise.
- Improve organizational resilience through lessons learned from incidents.

---

## Scope
This IRP applies to:
- **Critical Systems**: All IT systems, applications, and networks within the organization.
- **Data**: Sensitive and business-critical data, whether on-premises or cloud-based.
- **Personnel**: Internal and external stakeholders involved in incident response efforts.

## Incident Categories
### Classification of Incidents
1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Examples: Compromised user accounts, unauthorized system access.
2. **Malware and Ransomware**:
   - Examples: Ransomware infections, spyware, or viruses.
3. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**:
   - Examples: Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) causing service outages.
4. **Data Breaches**:
   - Examples: Theft or exfiltration of sensitive data.
5. **Insider Threats**:
   - Examples: Malicious or accidental data leaks by employees.

## Incident Response Phases
### 1. Preparation
- Maintain an updated inventory of critical systems and data.
- Conduct regular incident response training for employees and stakeholders.
- Implement and monitor security controls, such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and SIEM tools.

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- Identify incidents through monitoring tools, logs, or reports.
- Analyze incident indicators, such as:
  - Unusual login activity.
  - Suspicious network traffic.
- Determine the scope and severity of the incident.

### 3. Containment
- **Short-Term Containment**:
  - Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
- **Long-Term Containment**:
  - Apply patches, updates, or mitigations to secure the environment.

### 4. Eradication
- Remove malicious code or unauthorized access.
- Conduct a root cause analysis to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities.

### 5. Recovery
- Restore systems to normal operations using verified backups.
- Monitor restored systems for signs of recurring issues.

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review within 30 days.
- Document findings, including:
  - What went well.
  - Areas for improvement.
- Update the IRP and other security policies based on lessons learned.

---

## Communication Plan
### Internal Communication
- Notify relevant stakeholders, including management, IT teams, and legal counsel.
- Provide regular status updates throughout the response process.

### External Communication
- Notify affected parties (e.g., customers, partners) as required.
- Engage public relations and legal counsel for external messaging.
- Comply with regulatory notification requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

---

## Testing and Maintenance
### Testing Schedule
- **Frequency**:
  - Quarterly tabletop exercises.
  - Annual full-scale simulations.

### Testing Methods
- Validate the effectiveness of detection, containment, and recovery steps.
- Ensure all personnel understand their roles and responsibilities.

### Plan Updates
- **Triggers for Updates**:
  - Significant organizational changes.
  - Changes in regulatory requirements.
  - Lessons learned from incidents.
