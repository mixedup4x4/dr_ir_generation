# Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## Purpose
The purpose of this Incident Response Plan (IRP) is to provide a structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. This plan aligns with **NIST 800-53**, **FISMA**, and **FedRAMP** standards to ensure compliance and best practices in incident management.

## Objectives
- Minimize the impact of incidents on organizational operations.
- Protect sensitive data and systems from unauthorized access or damage.
- Restore normal operations as quickly as possible.
- Comply with regulatory and legal requirements.
- Improve organizational resilience through post-incident learning.

## Scope
This IRP applies to all systems, networks, applications, and personnel within the organization. It includes incidents affecting:
- On-premises and cloud environments.
- Internal and external stakeholders.
- Physical and digital assets.

## Incident Categories
Define categories of incidents and provide examples:
1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Example: Compromised user accounts, unauthorized login attempts.
2. **Malware/Ransomware**:
   - Example: Detected ransomware infections, malicious software activity.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**:
   - Example: Overwhelmed network traffic leading to service outages.
4. **Data Breach**:
   - Example: Exfiltration of sensitive data.
5. **Insider Threats**:
   - Example: Malicious or unintentional insider actions compromising systems or data.

## Incident Response Phases
### 1. Preparation
- Establish an incident response team (IRT) and define roles and responsibilities.
- Conduct regular security training and awareness programs.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation of systems and applications.
- Implement and monitor security controls.

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- Define methods for identifying incidents (e.g., log monitoring, intrusion detection systems).
- Document incident indicators (e.g., anomalous activity, alerts).
- Perform initial triage to classify the incident's severity and scope.
- Escalate incidents as necessary based on predefined criteria.

### 3. Containment
- Short-Term Containment:
  - Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
- Long-Term Containment:
  - Apply patches, updates, or mitigations to address vulnerabilities.

### 4. Eradication
- Remove malicious files, software, or actors from the environment.
- Identify root causes and ensure they are addressed.

### 5. Recovery
- Restore affected systems and services to normal operations.
- Validate the integrity of restored systems.
- Monitor systems closely for any signs of recurring issues.

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review within 30 days of incident resolution.
- Document findings, including:
  - What went well.
  - What could be improved.
  - Actionable recommendations.

## Communication Plan
### Internal Communication
- Notify key stakeholders, including management, IT, and legal teams.
- Provide regular updates on incident status.

### External Communication
- Notify affected parties (e.g., customers, partners) as required.
- Engage public relations and legal counsel for external messaging.
- Comply with regulatory notification requirements.

## Testing and Maintenance
### Testing Schedule
- Conduct regular incident response drills (e.g., tabletop exercises) to validate readiness.
- Perform annual reviews of the IRP.

### Plan Updates
- Update the IRP following major incidents, organizational changes, or new regulatory requirements.

## Appendices
