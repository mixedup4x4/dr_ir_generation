# Disaster Recovery Program (DRP)

## Purpose
The purpose of this Disaster Recovery Program (DRP) is to establish a framework for responding to disruptions and ensuring the continuity of critical business functions. This plan is designed to align with **NIST 800-53**, **FISMA**, and **FedRAMP** standards, ensuring compliance and best practices in disaster recovery and business continuity.

## Objectives
- Protect critical business operations from unexpected disruptions.
- Minimize downtime and data loss.
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Provide a step-by-step guide for disaster response and recovery.
- Safeguard organizational reputation and assets.

## Scope
This DRP applies to all systems, applications, networks, and processes identified as critical to organizational operations. The scope includes:
- On-premises and cloud-based environments.
- Internal and external stakeholders.
- Physical and digital assets.
